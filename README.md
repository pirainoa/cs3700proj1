I decided to use Python for this project, since it's what I've become accustomed to recently. I was able to figure out how to use sockets with few obstacles, and had my secret flag very quickly. My general strategy was to, after the first HELLO message, use a for loop that continued until I stopped receiving FIND messages.

I had more trouble when it came to testing. I wanted to make sure my program ran properly through the command line as specified in the Project description, but I ran into issues with being able to run it through the command line at all, handling arguments, and having print statements output so I could tell what was happening. I eventually gave up on getting things to work on my own machine's command line and decided to just run and check if the testing on the Khoury servers accepted it.
